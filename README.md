# Smart-Electric-meter
The main object of the project is to develop smart energy meter where it is not only used to measure the consumer’s power consumption in KWH but also enable and support real consumption in ksh and send bill using GSM according to consumer tariff, so meter reader don’t need to visit each customer for the consumed data collection and to distributed the bill slip. In our developed prototype of Smart Energy meter do not have any rotating parts. The energy consumption is calculated using measurement voltage and current with help of potential divider and ACS712, measure voltage and current respectively. Power product of voltage and current, its unit watt or KW and energy is product of power (watt) and time (Hour).
